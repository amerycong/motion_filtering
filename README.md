Here, we explored simple motion detection techniques through the use of a variety of ﬁlters. The basic principle behind motion detection lies in tracking pixel intensity over time and observing the rates of change of that intensity in order to extrapolate information.The scope of this project involves implementing this temporal derivative with a 1D diﬀerential operator in MATLAB on a series of still frames from recorded video, and examining diﬀerent ways to optimize the ﬁlter output to track movement across these frames.
